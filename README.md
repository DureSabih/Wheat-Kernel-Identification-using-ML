# Background

Machine learning is increasingly being used to the advantage of agrophysics and grain supply industry. 
Due to high demand the evolution of grain chain requires quality evaluation (Wrigley, 2017). 
Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that clusters unlabelled data into predefined number of clusters 
or groups by iteratively minimizing sum of differences between datapoints and their corresponding 
clusters. 
Currently in most agricultural counties the process of wheat identification, inspection and quality 
control is done manually, this process is quite time consuming. In this day and age, when machine 
learning is widely used across various industries for categorization, regression and forecasting etc 
(Khatri et.al.,2002), this draws the attention to a potential solution to problem at hand therefore, the 
objective of this task is to implement clustering methods on the seeds dataset to group the wheat grain 
varieties into the right category. Project will also aim at assessing which method is more suitable to 
the dataset based on evaluation metrics.

# About the dataset

Seeds dataset was sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository (2019) and contributed by 
Kulczycki et al. Dataset contains 210 instances of 3 types of wheat grains from experimental fields 
namely, Kama, Rosa and Canadian. Identification and study on geometrical attributes of wheat grain 
is an important indicator of the type of category it belongs to (Khatri et.al.,2002).. objective of this 
task is to predict the type of wheat by using a technique suitable for the type of dataset. For this reason, 
data is explored, and feature types are identified. Two clustering methods will be used and assessed 
on their accuracy.
